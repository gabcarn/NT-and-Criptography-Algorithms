# NT-and-Criptography-Algorithms
My implementation of algorithms related to Number Theory and Criptography.

Introduction
------------
During the Winter Break of 2025, I'm gonna travel to see my family after 6 months of work in college.
As I dont want to forget how to use github and how to study, I'm gonna implement some algorithms related
to Number Theory and Criptography, a course I'll enroll next semester (2025.2).

I'm going to use C++ for the implementations because:

1. Practice, since I plan to enroll in a course that uses it next semester;
2. It's a cool language;
3. It's kinda boring to work with strings in C and Python sucks.

DISCLAIMER
----------
I'm brazilian so sometimes I'll write in portuguese just because.
